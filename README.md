# M1: Machine Learning Coursework

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Packages

To install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt, within your projectâ€™s environment:

```bash

### 3. Project structure:

- The report is located in the `report` folder.

Three neural network models discussed in the report are saved in a folder called `nn_models` which contains:

- A folder `best_model` which contains the saved best model, its weights, and its saved training history.

- A folder `model_1` which contains the saved **Model 1**, its weights, and its saved training history.

- A folder `model_2` which contains the saved **Model 2**, its weights, and its saved training history.
